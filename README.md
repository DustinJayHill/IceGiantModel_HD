# IceGiantModel_HD
Hydrodynamic simulation of an ice giant planet

The composition of the planet--for the time--will be assumed to be 90%
water (ice), 8% hydrogen, and 2% helium.  This will appear in the 
definitions file.

4/4/17, I will run a simulation that initializes differential rotation as
a function of the radial component, to see what happens with the density
of the gas
